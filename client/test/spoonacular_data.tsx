      "instructions": "Preheat Oven Temperature to 350 degrees F\nFor the Cake:\nLine the bottom of the round cake pans with parchment paper (I use precut ones sold at baking stores), grease cake pans, also under parchment paper. Set aside.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk flours, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.\nUsing an electric mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment on medium high speed, beat sugar, Earth balance, and brown sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.\nAdd eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each egg, then add vanilla.\nAdd dry ingredients.\nMix on low speed, just to blend.\nAdd mashed bananas and sour cream; mix until just blended.\nFold in chocolate chips.\nDivide the batter evenly among the two cake pans. Smooth tops.\nBake cakes for 35-45 minutes, until toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.\nTransfer to wire racks.\nLet it cool in the pans for 15-30 minutes.\nInvert cakes onto the wire racks; peel off parchment paper and let it cool completely, about an hour, before frosting.\nFor the Frosting:\nUsing an electric mixer, or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat peanut butter, powdered sugar, Earth balance, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.\nPlace 1 cake on a platter.\nSpread 1 1/4 cups of frosting for the inner layer.\nPlace the other cake on top.\nFrost the top and sides with remaining frosting.\nPipe along the bottom edge with a star tip.\nChill frosted cake for 2-3 hours to set.\nGarnish with chocolate chips.\nServe chilled or room temperature. Chilled will result in a firm peanut butter frosting.\nNote: For mess free decorating, put two halved sheets of parchment paper (cut apart) next to each other on the cake platter before putting the cake on it.\nSlowly pull out from opposite ends of the cake when done piping.",
